# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help prepare a fictional company, Pewlett Hackard, for a round of upcomming retirements. We will be providing them how many employees of each title will be retiring, and which employees are elegible for mentoring new hires. 

## Results

Going off this data

- We see that the majority of people retiring are senior members of the company. Roughly 70% of the employees are search returned have these higher level positions.

- Engineers are the type of job with the most members leaving the company.

- There are virtually no managers retiring.

- The amount of eligable mentors drastically pales in comparison to the amount of people who need to be trained. There are only 1549 mentors compared to 36229 job openings.



## Summary

Our data shows that we will eventually need to fill 36229 jobs as people start retiring. This is an issue because there are not nearly enough qualified people to mentor and train new employees. As of right now, there are only 1549 eligable mentors. In order to gain more insight for what to do next, I believe we should first see how many employees of each type are remaining in the company. That way we can have more insight into possible promotions or other ways to fill jobs internally rather than try to hire outside people for senior level jobs. We also then can also expand the age group for the mentorship table to see if widening the parameters there will create enough people to train all of the potential new employees.
